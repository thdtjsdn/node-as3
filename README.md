node-as3
========

NodeAS3 is RedTamarin wrapped in NodeJS supporting AVMPlus, FPAPI, and PPAPIs

Basically you provide API-compatible AS3 (no MXML) and our NPM outputs AS3
listeners on dynami Express routes. This should allow us to use AS3 as a 
filter language on the server-side thanks in large part to the work
by RedTamarin team (aka Zwetan). 

stay tuned!
